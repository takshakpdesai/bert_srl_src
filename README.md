This repository contains code for training simple BERT models for semantic relation classification or semantic role labelling.

1. Semantic Relation Classification

As introduced in the SemEval 2010 Task 8, this code aims to classify semantic relations between nominals in a sentence. It assumes that the arguments between which relation holds is already provided. The data for this can be downloaded from https://github.com/sahitya0000/Relation-Classification

2. Semantic Role Labelling

As introduced in CoNLL 2005 Shared Task, this code aims to classify semantic roles with respect to a given verb in a sentence. The data for this task is available at https://www.cs.upc.edu/~srlconll/. Please note that you will need access to the LDC for downloading this dataset.
